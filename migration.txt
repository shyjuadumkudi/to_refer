 1. Identify which migration created the wrong table

Suppose the bad migration was 0015_create_wrong_table (example).
Find the migration file under:
myapp/migrations/0015_create_wrong_table.py

If there are dependent migrations (0016, 0017, etc.), you may need to fix them too.

2. Delete the old migration file(s)

Delete the wrong migrations.

Example:
rm myapp/migrations/0015_create_wrong_table.py
rm myapp/migrations/0016_insert_data.py  # if you have separate data insert
# delete further dependent migrations too if needed (0017, 0018...)


3. Drop the wrong table from database

Since you don't care about the existing data, connect to your Yugabyte database and drop the wrong table manually.

Example (psql or ycql):
DROP TABLE myapp_mymodel;

4. Update models.py

In myapp/models.py, fix your model so that the correct primary key is defined.

Example corrected model:
class MyModel(models.Model):
    new_primary_key_col = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=100)
    other_column1 = models.TextField()
    other_column2 = models.IntegerField()
    # remove old 'id' field if it was wrongly there


5. Fake migrate back if needed

Since Django's migration table still thinks you're at 0020, you should reset it.

Rollback to a safe migration before the wrong one (say 0014).

Run:
python manage.py migrate myapp 0014

6. Make fresh migration

Now recreate the migration cleanly:
python manage.py makemigrations myapp

This will create something like:
myapp/migrations/0015_correct_create_table.py
(Notice 0015 again â€” since you rolled back.)

If you have initial data to insert (seed data), create it via RunPython in a separate migration if needed.

7. Migrate cleanly

Finally apply migrations forward:
python manage.py migrate myapp

## Full Command Set

# Delete old wrong migrations
rm myapp/migrations/0015_create_wrong_table.py
rm myapp/migrations/0016_insert_data.py

# Drop table manually
# (login to DB first)
DROP TABLE myapp_mymodel;

# Fake migrate back to before broken migrations
python manage.py migrate myapp 0014 --fake

# Fix models.py with correct primary key

# Make new migrations
python manage.py makemigrations myapp

# Apply fresh migrations
python manage.py migrate myapp
