1. Introduction
Objective: Provide an overview of the session's goals, which include understanding key development practices and processes. This will help set expectations for what attendees will learn.
Target Audience: Clarify that the session is aimed at non-developers who are interested in learning how to automate tasks by developing scripts and adhering to best practices.
2. Python-Based Development
Overview: Python is a popular language for automation due to its readability and extensive library support. It’s widely used for writing scripts that perform various tasks.
Basic Syntax: Introduce fundamental Python concepts such as:
Variables: Storing values (x = 5)
Functions: Reusable blocks of code (def my_function():)
Loops: Iterating over data (for item in list:)
Libraries & Frameworks: Highlight useful libraries for automation, like:
Requests: For HTTP requests
Pandas: For data manipulation
BeautifulSoup: For web scraping
3. Coding Guidelines
PEP 8: The official style guide for Python code, which promotes code readability and consistency.
Code Readability: Emphasize the importance of writing clear and understandable code to make it easier for others (and yourself) to maintain and debug.
Documentation: Use docstrings to describe the purpose of functions, classes, and modules. Good documentation helps others understand your code.
4. GitHub
Overview: GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It hosts repositories and tracks changes to code.
Repositories: Explain how to create and manage repositories, which store your project’s code and version history.
Branching: Describe branches as separate lines of development. Branching allows multiple features or fixes to be developed in parallel without interfering with the main codebase.
5. Commit Practices
Commit Messages: Good commit messages should be descriptive and explain the changes made. For example, “Fixed bug in user authentication module” is better than “Fixed bug.”
Frequency: Regular commits (after each logical change) keep your history clean and make it easier to track changes.
Atomic Commits: Each commit should represent a single change or fix, making it easier to understand the purpose of each commit and to revert if necessary.
6. Code Reviews
Purpose: Code reviews help ensure code quality, catch bugs early, and facilitate knowledge sharing among team members.
Best Practices: Provide constructive feedback, focus on the code (not the coder), and ensure that reviews are thorough but respectful.
Tools: Use GitHub’s pull request feature to review code changes. Comment directly on lines of code and discuss improvements.
7. Pull Requests
Overview: A pull request (PR) is a request to merge code changes from one branch into another. It’s a key part of collaborative development.
Creating a PR: Describe the process of creating a PR, including selecting the branch with your changes, providing a description, and submitting the request.
Review Process: Explain how to review a PR by checking the code changes, running tests, and providing feedback. Once reviewed, the PR can be merged into the target branch.
8. Deployment Process
Overview: Deployment involves moving code from development to production. It often includes several steps like building, testing, and releasing.
Tools Used:
GitHub: Manages source code and integrates with other tools.
Jenkins: Automates build and test processes. It can trigger builds based on changes in GitHub.
UrbanCode Deploy (Udeploy): Manages the deployment of code to different environments (staging, production).
CI/CD Pipeline: A continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying to production.
9. Secure Coding
Principles: Secure coding practices help prevent vulnerabilities. This includes:
Input Validation: Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
Authentication: Implement secure methods for user authentication.
Error Handling: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
Common Vulnerabilities: Awareness of issues like SQL injection (malicious SQL in input), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and how to mitigate them.
10. Tools Integrated in CI/CD Pipeline
Overview: Tools in the CI/CD pipeline help automate various aspects of software development and deployment.
Examples:
Testing Tools: Tools like pytest or JUnit for automated testing.
Monitoring Tools: Tools that track application performance and health (e.g., Prometheus).
Integration: Describe how these tools work together in the pipeline to ensure smooth development and deployment processes.
11. Unit Testing
Purpose: Unit testing involves testing individual components (units) of the code to ensure they work as expected.
Writing Tests: Focus on creating tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases.
Testing Frameworks: Introduce frameworks like:
pytest: A powerful testing framework with many features.
unittest: Python’s built-in module for unit testing.
12. SDLC Process
Phases: The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes stages like:
Planning: Defining requirements and scope.
Design: Creating architectural and design plans.
Development: Writing and building the code.
Testing: Verifying that the code works as expected.
Deployment: Releasing the code to production.
Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates.
Models: Overview of different models like Waterfall (sequential phases) and Agile (iterative and incremental).
Best Practices: Follow established practices in each phase to ensure quality and efficiency.
13. Q&A
Open Floor: Allow time for attendees to ask questions and clarify any doubts they have about the topics covered.
14. Conclusion
Summary: Recap the key points discussed during the session.
Resources: Provide additional materials or links for further learning (e.g., documentation, tutorials).
