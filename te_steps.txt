Log in to ThousandEyes.
Navigate to Tests > Add New Test > Web > Web Transaction.
Configure basic settings:
Test Name: Parse JSON Response Test
Target URL: https://testapp.net/ht/?format=json
Interval: Set the desired monitoring frequency (e.g., every 5 minutes).



3. Configure Alerts
Go to the Alert Rules section in ThousandEyes.
Create a new alert rule:
Rule Name: Web Transaction JSON Status Check.
Condition: Set the alert to trigger if the test fails.
Notification Email: Specify email recipients to receive alerts.

4. Save and Run the Test
Save the test configuration.
Deploy the test and monitor the results.


Expected Behavior
If all components return "working", the test passes.
If any component deviates (e.g., "unavailable" or missing), the test fails, logs the failed components, and triggers the configured alert rule.


Workflow:
Load the Page: Access https://testapp.net/ht/?format=json.
Extract JSON: Directly capture the JSON text served by the endpoint.
Validate Components: Check the status of database, cyberark, infoblox, and Redis.
Report Failures: Log failed components and fail the test if any component is not working.
Take Screenshots: Captures screenshots after key steps for debugging.
Deploy this in your ThousandEyes Web Transaction Test with the target URL
