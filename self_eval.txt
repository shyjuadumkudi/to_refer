###Summary
In the first half of the year, I focused on improving engineering efficiency, driving key project deliverables, and collaborating across teams to support successful outcomes. I adopted tools like GitHub Copilot to boost productivity, maintained strong code quality metrics, and played a central role in delivering database integration, automation, and configuration tasks across multiple environments. I actively supported cross-functional coordination with vendors, DBAs, and internal teams to troubleshoot and resolve issues. Additionally, I fulfilled organizational expectations by completing all mandatory trainings and participating in team representation initiatives.


###Engineering Persona Goals
