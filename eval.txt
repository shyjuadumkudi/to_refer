I have actively contributed to the development of the HC application and will maintain my focus on API development moving forward. My primary responsibilities will involve collaborating with the Database team to address existing migration issues, ensuring the system's stability and integrity. Additionally, I will work on completing the implementation and testing of ThousandEyes monitoring to enhance visibility and performance tracking. A significant portion of my time will also be dedicated to designing and developing new features aimed at improving system functionality. Furthermore, deepening my domain knowledge in DDI (DNS, DHCP, and IPAM) will be crucial for aligning with project requirements and effectively contributing to our overall goals.
