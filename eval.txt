As part of the ongoing responsibilities, the primary focus will be on collaborating with the Database team to resolve existing migration issues, ensuring the stability and integrity of the system. In addition, efforts will be directed toward completing the implementation and testing of ThousandEyes monitoring for enhanced visibility and performance tracking. A significant portion of time will also be dedicated to the design and development of new features, particularly API enhancements to improve system functionality. Lastly, increasing domain knowledge in DDI (DNS, DHCP, and IPAM) will be essential to better align with project requirements and contribute more effectively to the overall goals.
