{
  "network_id": "127.16.1.0/24"
}
Expected Response:

Status Code: 200 OK
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Subnet 127.16.1.0/24 deleted successfully"

  "network_id": "invalid_network_id"
}
Expected Response:

Status Code: 400 Bad Request
Body:

Copy code
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid network ID format"
}
4. Test Case: Subnet Not Found
Description: Verify that an appropriate error message is returned when the network_id does not exist.

Request:

Method: DELETE
URL: /api/delete_subnet/
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "network_id": "192.168.1.0/24"
}
Expected Response:

Status Code: 404 Not Found
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Subnet not found or already deleted"
}
5. Test Case: Authentication Failure
Description: Verify that an appropriate error message is returned when authentication fails.

Request:

Method: DELETE
URL: /api/delete_subnet/
Headers: Content-Type: application/json

  "message": "Authentication failed"
}
6. Test Case: Internal Server Error
Description: Verify that an appropriate error message is returned when there is an internal server error.

Request:

Method: DELETE
URL: /api/delete_subnet/
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "network_id": "127.16.1.0/24"
