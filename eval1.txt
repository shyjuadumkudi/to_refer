Risk Overlay Expectations
All mandatory trainings were completed on time, ensuring compliance with organizational policies and minimizing risks related to governance, security, and process adherence.

During development, a technical risk was identified involving the use of composite primary keys in Django. The current Django framework version did not support this requirement, which posed a risk to the timely implementation of features dependent on composite keys.

To address this, the issue was thoroughly tested and validated. After confirming the limitation, the decision was made to upgrade to a higher Django version that supports composite primary keys.

This proactive step helped mitigate potential development delays and ensured architectural alignment with the project requirements.
