In the first half of the year, I demonstrated strong ownership and technical leadership across multiple areas of development and project delivery. I successfully contributed to backend enhancements, database integration, automation, and cross-team collaboration. I maintained high code quality standards, ensured timely completion of mandatory trainings, and proactively addressed technical risks such as framework limitations. My focus has been on delivering scalable solutions, improving system reliability, and aligning with team and organizational goals. In the coming months, I aim to continue building on this momentum by completing the Global Output Standard implementation, advancing HostConnect features, resolving database performance issues, and developing a robust metadata validation engine
